# Breast Cancer Detection Models

This repository contains machine learning models for detecting breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Models
1. Logistic Regression (main branch)
2. Random Forest (another_model branch)

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)).

## Usage
Run the scripts to train and evaluate the models. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed within the scripts.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
